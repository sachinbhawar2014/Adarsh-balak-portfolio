        <h3><strong>My journey with coding </strong></h3>

        <p >I remember in 2007, my parents purchased desktop PC for me. It was first computer in our home. At that time I was in second year of my engineering degree. When I was in 12th standard, I had chosen Computer Science as my vocational subject which was optional. In my 12th standard, we have given brief idea about C++ and C. In first year of our degree, we had subject named basic computer Technology. In that subject we have been taught C++ coding. Mechanical engineering graduation program I have used C++, Matlab. 
I was interested in coding since my I 12th standard, but I never thought that I can make career out of it. When my cousin passed out his computer engineering degree and got job in reputed company, he realized me that anyone with good hand in coding can get better job whatever is his/her educational background. </p>
        <h3><strong>Choosing coding as tool to get job </strong></h3>
        <p>
In 2020, the whole world was suffering from covid. Lockdowns were enforced to stop spread of covid. In that critical time new novels were introduced. As many companies are allowed their employees to work from home the internet became the the prime need many people. So, by Spotting this business opportunity me and my cousin started our small startup called NetcloneX broadband service in Nashik. Because of the business operations I got fair chance to to get in touch with my cousin who was working in in IT sector. I used to discuss with him about career. One day he came with idea that many people are making their career out of their coding skills then why can't I. He convinced me to improve my coding skills and also told me that there are huge opportunities open for people who code. By the time I got a job of marketing executive in Amanta Healthcare. But after 8-9 months of dedicated service to Amanta Healthcare I realise that I have more potential which can be used to make even more reputed career opportunity. 
So after leaving amanta Healthcare I decided to to focus on encoding dedicatedly. My cousin Mohit also gave me ideas about the websites which offers online courses for coding. 
In this way my journey with coding has started. No I am completing Neog camp level 0 coding and I am enjoying it very much.</p>
